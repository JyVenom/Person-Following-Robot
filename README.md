# Person-Following-Robot
In this project, I built an android application that uses tensorflow lite to detect people seen by the rear camera of a smartphone. The phone is mounted on a servo on an arduino based robot. The application continuosly calculates the center and size of the bounding box arround a person if one is found. It also maintains a background thread to send commands over bluetooth to the robot to move accordingly to keep the person both in frame (panning the robot and tilting the phone) and of an acceptable size (moving forwards and backwards).
