# Person-Following-Robot
In this project, I built an android application that uses tensorflow lite to detect people seen by the rear camera. It then calculates the center and size of the bounding box, and sends commands over bluetooth to an arduino based robot to move accordingly to keep a person both in frame and of an acceptable size.
